Performed on MNIST Dataset

 
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 

Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.

The original creators of the database keep a list of some of the methods tested on it. 

An extended dataset similar to MNIST called EMNIST has been published in 2017, which contains 240,000 training images, and 40,000 testing images of handwritten digits and characters.
